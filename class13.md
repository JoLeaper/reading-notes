# Reading 13 Local Storage Article

## The Gist:
Basically, HTML5 uses a type of web storage that creates local storage. It stores key/value pairs in the web browser, so it remains even when navigating away from the page. This data does is not transmitted unless the user gives explicit consent to do so.

When using HTML5 storage, it is based on key value pairs. The key is a string, and the data can be anything (strings, Booleans, integers, floats). But if you are wanting to store/retrieve non-strings, you must use parseInt/ParseFloat.
